# Card Game

This project was created in C++ using fundementals in Object Oriented Programming. 

Rules of the game:

There are five rounds. Each round is played as follows:

1. Computer moves first by selecting a card from its hand. Human sees the card the computer has played.
2. Human selects a card from their hand to play against the computerâ€™s card.
3. The player whose card has the larger value wins the round. Any card can be played against any other card. Only their value determines who wins the round.
4. The player who wins the round is awarded points equal to the sum of the values of the two cards.
5. If there is a tie, no player receives points.

After five rounds, the player with the most points wins.
